Burrows-wheeler transform in Swift
===============================

Implementation of the burrows-wheeler transform in Swift.

I wrote this to learn more about Swift, you can compare it to [an implementation in Ruby](https://github.com/zetter/burrows-wheeler-transform/blob/implementation/lib/bwt.rb).

Comments on style and APIs used appreciated.
